This project is part of the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate Capstone and focuses on performing a comprehensive analysis of historical stock data for Tesla and other selected companies. It involves scraping and preprocessing financial data, visualizing trends, and generating insights using Python-based data science tools.

### üîç Project Highlights

- **Web Scraping**: Extracted Tesla revenue data from Macrotrends using `requests`, `BeautifulSoup`, and `pandas`.
- **Data Cleaning**: Converted scraped HTML tables into structured DataFrames, cleaned financial figures (e.g., removed dollar signs, commas).
- **Data Wrangling**: Merged revenue data with historical stock prices pulled from Yahoo Finance using `yfinance`.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Plotted revenue trends over time and examined how Tesla‚Äôs financial growth correlates with stock price movement.
- **Tools Used**:
  - `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `BeautifulSoup`, `yfinance`, `requests`
  - Jupyter Notebooks (for exploratory and visual analysis)
  
### üìä Objective
